The 525 Icons font is found at
  http://525icons.com/index.html

According to the bottom of the page, it's released under the OFL 1.1 licence.
,----
| The 525icons font is licensed under SIL OFL 1.1

This links to http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

That page (which redirects to a more complex URL) links to the 1.1 licence at
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web


According to PERMISSIONS & CONDITIONS in that licence, "Permission is
hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the
Font Software, to [...] embed [...] modified and unmodified copies of
the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:"

The conditions don't affect our intended use, namely inclusion of the
font file inside the ModelWorks jar for use in our GUI, and any
screenshots that this might result in:

 1. We are not any font-related content by itself.

 2. We are "embedding", and hence not "bundling" (e.g. producing a
    collection of fonts for people to use).  For example of why we
    think "bundling" == "making a collection available for users to
    use directly", see the last sentence of FAQ entry at
    http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL-FAQ_web#fa29573b

| Question: 1.21 What about including OFL fonts by default in my
| firmware or dedicated operating system?
| 
| Answer: [...] Alternatively if you directly add a font under the OFL
| to the font folder of your firmware without modifying or optimizing it
| you are simply bundling the font like with any other software
| collection, and do not need to make any further changes.
`----

    We think we *are* embedding (and hence not bundling) because of
    FAQ 1.11, at
    http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL-FAQ_web#e6faa5ad
,----
| Question: 1.11 What do you mean by 'embedding'? How does that differ
| from other means of distribution?
| 
| Answer: By 'embedding' we mean inclusion of the font in a document or
| file in a way that makes extraction (and redistribution) difficult or
| clearly discouraged. [...]
`----
    which clearly seems to fit with our "that font is buried inside
    the ModelWorks jar file" intention.  (If we had this in a separate
    directory that users could easily view, we'd be bundling, and
    would need to include a licence file alongside per 2.)

 3. We have no intention of modifying the font, or presenting any kind
    of font name to users.

 4. We have no intention of using the font designer's names to promote
    ModelWorks.

 5. We are not "distributing" the font, only embedding it.  See the
    FAQ 1.11 above for a start, plus also
    http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL-FAQ_web#3ce192cf
,----
| Question: 1.3 I want to distribute the fonts with my program. Does
| this mean my program also has to be Free/Libre and Open Source
| Software?
| 
| Answer: No. Only the portions based on the Font Software are required
| to be released under the OFL. The intent of the license is to allow
| aggregation or bundling with software under restricted licensing as
| well.
`----


Given the above, plus the observation that the SIL fonts have been
distributed under the Apache licence (which is also
ModelWorks-friendly), I am happy that this font can be used with
ModelWorks.
